# Phase 2: Sales Product Analysis
## Overview
In Phase 2, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of our sales products to identify trends, performance metrics, and areas for improvement. This phase focused on evaluating product sales volume, product revenue, product profitability, and primary vs secondary items.

## Analysis 1: Product Sales Volume
We analyzed the sales volume of each product over 2012-2015. The top-performing products in terms of sales volume were identified, key findings include:
Our data contains four products there names and sales over this time interval are as follows:
- The Original Mr. Fuzzy: **24226** units sold
- The Forever Love Bear: **5796** units sold
- The Hudson River Mini bear: **5018** units sold
- The Birthday Sugar Panda: **4985** units sold

From this findings, it is clear that "The Original Mr. Fuzzy" is the most popular product by a significant margin. Therefore, it should receive prioritized focus in marketing and inventory planning.  
### SQL Query
```sql 
-- Which product sells most units?

USE ToyStoreEcommrce

SELECT 
	oi.product_id,
	p.product_name,
	COUNT(oi.product_id) units_sold
FROM order_items oi
LEFT JOIN products p
ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY 
	oi.product_id,
	p.product_name
ORDER BY units_sold DESC;
```

## Analysis 2: Product Revenue 
We evaluated the total revenue generated by each product from 2012 to 2015. The products with the highest revenue were:
- The Original Mr. Fuzzy: **$121,105,7**
- The Forever Love Bear: **$347,702**
- The Hudson River Mini bear: **$150,489**
- The Birthday Sugar Panda: **$229,260**
  
"The Original Mr. Fuzzy" again leads in revenue, indicating its strong market presence. However, "The Forever Love Bear" also shows significant revenue despite lower sales volume, suggesting a higher price point or premium positioning.  
### SQL Query
```sql
-- Which products generate the most revenue?

USE ToyStoreEcommrce

SELECT
	oi.product_id,
	product_name,
	COUNT(oi.product_id) units_sold,
	ROUND(AVG(price_usd),2) price,
	ROUND(SUM(price_usd),2) total_revenue
FROM order_items oi
LEFT JOIN products p
ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY 
	oi.product_id,
	product_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```
SQL file: [02_product_revenue.sql](02_product_revenue.sql)


## Analysis 3: Product Profitability
We assessed the profitability of each product by calculating the profit margin based on cost and selling price. The profitability ranking is as follows:
- The Original Mr. Fuzzy: **61% profit margin**
- The Forever Love Bear: **63% profit margin**
- The Hudson River Mini bear: **68% profit margin**
- The Birthday Sugar Panda: **68% profit margin**  

"The Hudson River Mini bear" and "The Birthday Sugar Panda" have the highest profit margins, indicating efficient cost management or premium pricing strategies.

### SQL Query
```sql
-- Profitability by Product

USE ToyStoreEcommrce


SELECT 
	oi.product_id,
	product_name,
	ROUND(SUM(price_usd),2) total_revenue,
	ROUND(SUM(cogs_usd),2) total_cost,
	ROUND(SUM(price_usd) - SUM(cogs_usd),2) AS total_product_profit,
	SUM(ROUND(SUM(price_usd - cogs_usd),2)) OVER() total_profit,
	ROUND(
		(SUM(price_usd - cogs_usd)*100)/SUM(price_usd),
		2
		)  profit_margin,
	ROUND(((SUM(price_usd) - SUM(cogs_usd))/SUM((SUM(price_usd) - SUM(cogs_usd))) OVER())*100, 2) '% contribution'
FROM order_items oi
LEFT JOIN products p
ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY 
	oi.product_id,
	product_name
ORDER BY oi.product_id;
```
SQL file: [03_product_profitability.sql](03_product_profitability.sql)

## Analysis 4: Primary vs Secondary Items
This analysis mainly focused on understanding the pruchase behavior of customers weather they tend to buy primary items only or they also buy secondary items along with primary items. Or in other words, do customers mainly pruchase one type of item or multiple types of items (bundle) in a single order.
The findings are as follows:
- primary items percentage of total sold items: **81%**
- secondary items percentage of total sold items: **19%**
- orders with single item: **61.5%**
- orders with two items: **38.5%**
  
This indicates that a significant portion of customers prefer to purchase just single items rather than bundling multiple items together. Despite the dominance of single-item orders, the **38.5%** multi-item orders represent a strong cross-sell opportunity if properly incentivized. I recommend exploring strategies to encourage bundling, such as discounts on multi-item purchases or promotional offers.  
### SQL Query
```sql
/* Analysis 4: Primary vs Secondary Items

Business Question:
	Do customers mainly buy one product or bundle items? 
*/

USE ToyStoreEcommrce


-- Primary vs Secondary Items

SELECT 
	is_primary_item,
	COUNT(order_item_id) items_count,
	ROUND(
		CAST(COUNT(order_item_id) AS float)/SUM(COUNT(order_item_id)) OVER() * 100
		, 2) 'percentage'
FROM order_items
GROUP BY is_primary_item



-- items count for each bundle size 

SELECT 
	items_purchased bundle_size,
	COUNT(order_item_id) items_count,
	ROUND(
		CAST(COUNT(order_item_id) AS float)/SUM(COUNT(order_item_id)) OVER() * 100
		, 2) 'percentage'
FROM order_items oi
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
GROUP BY items_purchased;
```
